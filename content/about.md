Big data, also called high-dimensional data, allow economists to achieve a better estimation of economic effects and outcomes, while also brings many challenges to traditional econometric theory at the same time.

One of the **core** methods for handling high dimensional data is through factor analysis. The idea of factor analysis is that it can use a few latent factors to capture the variations of a large number of economic variables in a high dimensional data set. A critical question and also a big challenge in factor analysis is to estimate the number of factors. Most methods for choosing the number of factors are based on the results from random matrix theory (RMT), which require i.i.d and gaussian assumption on the error terms.  These restrictions may not appropriate when we want to apply those methods in practice.

This paper aims to show that those methods are **not robust** by simulation when the error terms in the factor model are serially and cross-sectionally correlated or have non-gaussian distributions. Our simulation results provide useful recommendations to applied users for how to choose the estimation method in dealing with different types of data.
